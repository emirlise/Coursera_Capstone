With that said, I would like to explore the relationship between the proximity to the sea & touristic attractions and the food business. To do so, I will be exploring Istanbul, Izmir and Antalya as touristic coastal cities. I will check whether the coastal neighbourhoods have the most food selection in every three city. Exploration of this relationship would benefit city planning for a better tourism and could also affect the invesment decision made in the restaurant market of these cities."
